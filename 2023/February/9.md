### 1. docker-compose .env file
- To use dynamic variables, we can use .env file
- create .env file in the same root path with docker-compose.yml file
- docker-compose array is not supported : https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/4249
- Likewise, I can use system env variable to docker-compose file as well.
- I have to use env file to Docker-compose volumn. There are difference between DEV branch and PROD branch.
- DEV branch has 3 volumn path and PROD branch has 5 volumn path. but Docker-compose doesn't provide array. How to solve this???

### 2. Difference between service name and container name in docker-compose
- service name is related to network 
- container name is just container name
- it's okay to not to be same
