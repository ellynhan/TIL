### 1. CSS Position
- relatve: place based on its static location
- absolute: place based on the nearest parent's location
- I thought relative attribute is placing item based on other components, but it wasn't

### 2. CSS Selector 
- select two element : write one down just next to the other one
- select child element : put blank or > between parent and child

- Even though path names are different, if there are same classname in both css file, only one of them works.
