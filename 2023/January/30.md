### 1. Context API and Redux 
- not that different. but when we use many context or middleware, it would be better to use Redux
- But if we don't use middleware, use only Context API is better for not getting dependency because it's React built-in function 

### 2. React Route parameter - match/location/history
- match: info about route path(stated) and URL(actual)
- location: current page info (location.search: query string of current url)
- history: similiar with brower history. save info in stack.
  - length: entire length of stack
  - action: the lastest executed action (PUSH, REPLACE, POP)
  - etc.
