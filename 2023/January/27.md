### difference between forEach and for in Javascript
- For Loop: The JavaScript for loop is used to iterate through the array or the elements for a specified number of times.
- forEach Loop: For every single element of the array, the callback function will be executed.

| For Loop	| forEach Loop |
| --------- | ---------- |
|It is one of the original ways of iterating over an array.	| It is a newer way with lesser code to iterate over an array. |
|It is faster in performance. |	It is slower than the traditional loop in performance. |
|The break statement can be used to come out from the loop. |	The break statement cannot be used because of the callback function. |
|The parameters are the iterator, counter, and incrementor.	| The parameters are the iterator, index of item, and array to iterate. |
|It works with the await keyword. |	The await keyword cannot be used due to the callback function. It may lead to incorrect output. |
